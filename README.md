# Identifying-ships-from-Space-Borne-Photography
The aim of the project is to identify ships in a satellite image. The satellite image contains huge amount of information, I would like to identify where the ships are located in the image. In order to do this I would like to use Convolution Neural Networks(CNN) to classify the visualized data and create a model for detecting ships.
